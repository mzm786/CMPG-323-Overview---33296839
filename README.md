# CMPG-323-Overview---33296839
This is my semester plan for CMPG 323
## Project 2 Repository
An API Repository will be created for this project
### Project 3 Repository
A repository for patterns and designs will be created
#### Project 4 Repository
A repository for UAT testing will be created. 
This project was interesting. Used the video resource that was provided to assist me with the completion of the project. I had no issues in completing this project. 
##### Project 5 Repository
A repository Reporting and data visualization will be created.
This was a project I was really looking forward to as I got an opportunity to use my certified knowledge as well as going through the training provided a refresher in completing the project. I did the certification in 2019 via my previous employment but never got to use the tool as I am a certified MicroStrategy developer which is the tool I have been using for the last 5 years (previous and current employment). I had no issues in completing this project.  
###### Branching Strategy
The main branching strategy that will be used within each project will be to develop, test and release to main. For Project 3 to 5 this these will be feature releases
